This is a mod for a game called Don't Starve Together.

It adds the functionality to do everything you can do normally on a beefalo.

Currently, most of the actions doesn't work. Guaranteed working actions are:
1. picking (grass/twig/flower .etc), 
2. picking up (things dropped on the ground)
3. use structures that doesn't have sub-interfaces (like chest/chester)

# TODO 
1. [x] Add SPACE support (press space to automatically do things)
2. [ ] Chop/Dig/Mine/Hammer ... (should all use the same fix)
3. [ ] Use structures like chester/crockpot/fridge
 - check out componentactions 
4. [ ] Feed beefalo while on it (probably hard)
