This is a mod for a game called Don't Starve Together.

It adds the functionality to do everything you can do normally on a beefalo.

Currently, most of the actions doesn't work. Guaranteed working actions are:
1. picking (grass/twig/flower .etc), 
2. picking up (things dropped on the ground)
3. storing (things in chest/chester)
